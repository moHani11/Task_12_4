## This repo shows my work in the Task 12.4 

- I have made a **c++ class** that can Implement PID to control any analog output for an arduino.   
- I have applied an exponential smoothing Filter for the output signal to avoid overshooting, undershooting and for more stability.    
- To check the integrity of the PID class and to try it practicaly i have made a tinkercad simulation that works as follows:

> The simulation works as a
